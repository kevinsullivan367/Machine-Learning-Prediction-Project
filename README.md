# Machine-Learning-Prediction-Project
Binary classification project where I utilize various machine learning techniques to predict the smoking status of an individual based on bio-signal data.
I creatively approached this problem by conducting an extensive literature review to perform feature engineering that is grounded in scholarly research. I also fit 49,671 models across six different machine learning methods and found a pragmatic and accurate model that was accurate 80% of the time.

The approaches I used:

-> Logistic Regression

-> K-Nearest Neighbors

-> Linear Discriminant Analysis

-> Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

-> 5 and 10 Fold Cross Validation

-> Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection

-> Lasso and Ridge Regression
